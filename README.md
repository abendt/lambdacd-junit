# lambdacd-junit

A Clojure library to integrate Junit test reports in LambdaCD

## Usage

require lambdacd-junit 

```(:require
    [lambdacd-junit.core :as junit4]
)```

and pass the LambdaCD context, the directory with the junit xml result files, and the test report file patterns to the junit4-reports function:

```(junit4/junit4-reports ctx (str (:cwd args) "/build/test-results/") [#"TEST-.*"])```

cf. the tests in the core_test.clf file

After triggering the junit tests you should see an item 'Junit test results' including the test results below the details section generated by LambdaCD. 

To install lambdacd-junit locally use ```lein install```

Note, lambdacd-junit works best with LambdaCD 0.7.1 upwards.
