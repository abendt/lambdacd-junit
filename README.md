# lambdacd-junit

A Clojure library to integrate Junit test reports in LambdaCD

## Usage
* add `[lambdacd-junit "0.1.0"]` to your project dependencies 
* require lambdacd-junit 
`(:require [lambdacd-junit.core :as junit4])`
* and pass the LambdaCD context, the directory with the junit xml result files, and the test report file patterns to the junit4-reports function:
`(junit4/junit4-reports ctx (str (:cwd args) "/build/test-results/") [#"TEST-.*"])`
cf. the tests in the core_test.clf file
After triggering the junit tests you should see an item 'Junit test results' including the test results below the details section generated by LambdaCD. 
* To install lambdacd-junit locally clone this repository and do a `lein install`
* run the tests as usual with `lein test`
Note, lambdacd-junit works best with LambdaCD 0.7.1 upwards.
